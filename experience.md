### üìã *Technical Report Writing*

The main task of the position is public management through the drafting of technical reports to assess the compatibility of actions (works, activities, celebrations, etc.) with the current regulations of Protected Natural Areas . With this, decisions are made at a technical-environmental level on the compatibility or incompatibility of said actions.

### ü•æ *Fieldwork*

It is often necessary to go *in situ* of the places, to check the interventions to be carried out and to get a better idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat is intended to be done. In this way, I have learned the importance of attention to detail required as a technician, as well as the value of communication with other teammates and with the requesters themselves.

### üíª **Habilidades que he desarrollado como complemento**:

<u><i>An√°lisis de datos biol√≥gicos y geoespaciales:</i></u>

* Use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools, as well as the use of Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) web tools.
