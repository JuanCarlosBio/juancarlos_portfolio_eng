I was offered a one-year employment contract at the <u><strong>Island Council of Gran Canaria</strong></u>, in the <u><strong>Environmental Technical Service</strong></u> thanks to the opportunity provided by the New Employment Opportunities (NOE) project. Specifically, my position was <u><strong>environmental technician, Graduate in Biology.</strong></u>

## **Job duties and skills**:

### üìã *Technical Report Writing*

The main task of the position is public management through the drafting of technical reports to assess the compatibility of actions (works, activities, celebrations, etc.) with the current regulations of Protected Natural Areas . With this, decisions are made at a technical-environmental level on the compatibility or incompatibility of said actions.

### ü•æ *Fieldwork*

It is often necessary to go *in situ* of the places, to check the interventions to be carried out and to get a better idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat is intended to be done. In this way, I have learned the importance of attention to detail required as a technician, as well as the value of communication with other teammates and with the requesters themselves.

### üå≤üí¨ *Environmental Education Tasks*

I participated in field trips with the aim of environmental education, organizing events to raise awareness about the biodiversity of the Canary Islands. During these activities, I guided groups of people in recognizing native species and provided information about the Protected Natural Areas of Gran Canaria.

Additionally, I conducted research on the impact of feral chickens üêî in the Protected Natural Areas of the island. As part of this work, I created an informative message and shared it on social media (Facebook) to raise awareness about the issues caused by these animals and propose measures to take in case of sightings in the wild.

### Other Tasks by Personal Initiative: üìä *Data Analysis*

I proposed developing an application to maintain an inventory of species in the Protected Natural Area <u><strong>Site of Scientific Interest Jin√°mar C-29</strong></u>. This task included field sampling through field trips and the subsequent analysis of the collected data.

The application features <u>interactive tables, charts, and maps (GIS)</u> that enable the visualization and analysis of key information, such as species richness and the presence of invasive species.

I personally developed the base grids used in the application, and the source code is publicly available in my GitHub repository: [Source Code](https://github.com/JuanCarlosBio/Cuadriculas_Especies/blob/main/workflow.ipynb). For the rest, you have to contact with me.

Additionally, I have been working on an Excel database to manage and monitor activities carried out by one of the companies contracted by the Cabildo, GESPLAN (S.A.). This database enables the tracking of the materials used and allows data analysis (over a period from 2023 to 2024) to estimate costs for future projects and optimize the economic management of these initiatives.
