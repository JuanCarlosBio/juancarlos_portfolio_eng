My training covers geology, soil science, zoology, botany and ecology, which allows me to interpret, plan and design the territory and the landscape.

This has enabled me to carry out environmental impact assessments, diagnose environmental problems and propose effective solutions, helping to mitigate risks in a constantly changing environment.

During my senior year of college, I realized the importance of standing out in such a competitive field. Although biology includes subjects like computer science and statistics, the focus is often on laboratory and field techniques, which puts us at a disadvantage compared to other, more technical disciplines.

### <u>Transversal knowledge</u>

My background in science has provided me with solid skills in communication, searching and interpreting complex information, as well as in the use of office tools. These skills allow me to be a reliable and versatile professional in various sectors such as finance, trade and product marketing, as well as in the IT field.

</div>

After finishing my studies in Biology, I decided to specialize in Bioinformatics, combining my interest in programming with the analysis of biological data.

I delved into Big Data analysis, working with DNA and protein sequences in different “omic” areas. I learned to develop bioinformatics workflows and pipelines for genome sequencing, transcriptomes, metagenomic and proteomic analysis.

Although bioinformatics focuses on biological data, the methodologies and technologies I have acquired (such as Git, Conda, Snakemake) are applicable to other Data Science projects. You can explore some of the projects I have worked go to the page of ➡️ [my projects](https://juancarlosbio.github.io/juancarlos_portfolio_esp//proyectos/).
